# Iris: a game about perspective

## Description
Iris is an immersive story-game that tells the journey of a young girl with a vision disability made with SwiftUI  for iPad.

## Tecnologies
SwiftUI as the primary technology for developing the game's interactive elements and visual layout. Additionally, AVFoundation was used to play the soundtrack and implement sound effects, enhancing the overall gaming experience. I also used SpriteKit for the animations and UIKit to incorporate more essential interface features. 

## Features
The game features interactive mini-games and informative pop-ups about assistive technologies for the visually impaired. The illustrations evolve in brightness as the protagonist grows, enhancing immersion. Accessibility features such as optimized color contrast, font sizes, and OpenDyslexic font ensure inclusivity. Users can connect with organizations promoting inclusivity post-game.
